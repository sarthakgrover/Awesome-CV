%Using wireless biomedical armbands we gathered social network data of the in-
%teractions between players during soccer games. Having discovered highly correlated links, I
%developed an encounter based model built on experimental analysis. A sudden idea I had from
%Gaussian Hypothesis Testing verified the model’s theoretical soundness.    
    
%Using wireless biomedical armbands we gathered social network data of the interactions
%between players during soccer games. Having discovered highly correlated links, I developed an
%encounter based model built on experimental analysis, which can be used to improve real-time
%efficiency of routing protocols for sports monitoring. A sudden idea I had from Gaussian Hypothesis
%Testing verified the model’s theoretical soundness. My comprehensive work won the best student
%paper award at IEEE WiMob 2010. In the course of eleven weeks, working with the culturally diverse
%Network Research Group exposed me to cutting-edge application oriented research. I realized how
%important it is, as a researcher, to interact with other people working in the same field, and at the
%same time to be able to work individually.
